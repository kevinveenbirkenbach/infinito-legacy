## Idea

This software should offer a cloud based application\\framework for GUI and REST based development and data management.

### Core Functions, USP & Target
- High differentiable of rights for persons, groups and devices
- Data interface for persons and devices (IoT)
- Support of mixtures between executables and data
- Versioning of every state of the used data
- Automized transparency for users about their data and use
- Expanding the standard program paradigma of classes and objects through [sources](application/symfony/src/Entity/Source/README.md).
- Implementation of all big standard applications via API to manage them over one interface
- High scalability (IaaS compatible)

### Use Case
The following use case diagram is work in process and gives an short overview over the software and the actors.

## Administration
Further information you will find in the [administration README.md](./administration/README.md).

### Setup
To run the application you need docker.

After installing docker you just need to run
```bash
bash ./administration/init.sh
```
in the root directory of the repository.
## Architecture

### Application Architecture
Further information about the application and the architecture you will find in the [application README.md](./application/README.md).

### Server Architecture
To realize a high scalable and CI setup with [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) use the following schema.
